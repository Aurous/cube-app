## 🎯 Why Kitsune Cube?

As a software developer and speedcubing enthusiast, I've been inspired by amazing apps like Cubeast, Acubemy, and csTimer. Building on their ideas, I wanted to create something that combines the best of analytics, gamification, and replay features into one seamless experience. **Kitsune Cube** is the result—a feature-rich training platform designed to make every solve count.

**Free to use.** Built by a cuber, for cubers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave) for Web Bluetooth support
- A GAN smart cube (optional, manual timer available)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gisketch/kitsune-cube.git
cd kitsune-cube

# Install dependencies (installs for all workspaces)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build) for monorepo management:

```
/
├── apps/
│   └── web/          # Main web application
├── packages/         # Shared packages (future)
├── turbo.json        # Turborepo configuration
└── package.json      # Root workspace configuration
```

All development commands are run from the root using Turborepo, which orchestrates tasks across workspaces.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `apps/web/` directory:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Release Workflow

```bash
# 1. Update src/lib/changelog.ts with the NEW version first
# 2. Run the release command
npm run release:minor   # or release:patch

# 3. Script will:
#    ✓ Validate changelog matches new version
#    ✓ Bump package.json version
